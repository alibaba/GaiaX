import Layout, { Code } from '../../components/docs.js';
export default Layout;

# Installation
Start by creating a new project using `npm` / `yarn` and adding the `stretch-layout` dependency.

<Code lang="bash">{`
npm init wasm-app my-app
cd my-app
npm install --save stretch-layout
`}</Code>

We are ready to use Stretch! Open up `index.js` and replace its contents with the following. Once finished you should be able to run it with `npm run start` to see the results of this basic layout calculation in the logs.

<Code lang="typescript" file="index.js">{`
import { Allocator, Node } from 'stretch-layout';
 
const allocator = new Allocator();
const node = new Node(allocator, {width: 100, height: 100});
const layout = node.computeLayout();
 
console.log(layout.width, layout.height);
`}</Code>

To integrate Stretch into an existing app you will need to use a bundler such as webpack which supports web assembly. Have a look at the code generated by the project setup above to get a sense of what configuration is needed.

# Basics
`Node`s are the core building blocks of a stretch layout tree. A node needs a `Style` which describes the `flexbox` properties for the node. By adding nodes as children to a parent node we create a tree which we can perform layout on. The result of a layout computation is a tree of `Layout` nodes. This tree matches the structure of the `Node` tree but contains the computed layout of each node.

<Code lang="typescript" file="index.js">{`
import { Allocator, Node } from 'stretch-layout';
  
const allocator = new Allocator();
const node = new Node(allocator);
node.addChild(new Node(allocator,{width: 100, height: 100}));
const layout = node.computeLayout();
  
layout.width; // 100.0
layout.height; // 100.0
layout.childCount; // 1
`}</Code>

Nodes can be be mutated and stretch will automatically recompute only the subtrees which have changed. This is incredibly powerful if you have a large node tree, perhaps representing the UI of an app, and only need to change the height of a single element.

<Code lang="typescript" file="index.js">{`
import { Allocator, Node } from 'stretch-layout';
  
const allocator = new Allocator();
const node = new Node(allocator);
node.addChild(new Node(allocator, {width: 100, height: 100}));
 
node.computeLayout();
  
// Mutate node
node.setStyle({width: 100, height: 100})
 
// This call will return partially cached results
node.computeLayout();
`}</Code>

# Allocator
All stretch nodes are allocated within an allocator. All nodes in a tree should share the same allocator but can also be used across trees. Usually apps create a single Allocator.

<Code lang="typescript">{`constructor()`}</Code>

# Node
Create a new node with a given style. Style may be undefined to create a node with default styles however this is not very useful.

<Code lang="typescript">{`constructor(allocator: Allocator, style: Style)`}</Code>

----

Set the measure function on a node. This function will be called on leaf nodes to resolve the intrinsic size of the node given a set of constraints.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
setMeasure(measure: (width: number?, height: number?) => {
  width: number, 
  height: number,
})
`}</Code>

----

Adds a child to an existing node.

<Code lang="typescript">{`addChild(child: Node)`}</Code>

----

Removes a previously added child from an existing node.

<Code lang="typescript">{`removeChild(child: Node)`}</Code>

----

Removes the child at the given index of an existing node.

<Code lang="typescript">{`removeChildAtIndex(index: number)`}</Code>

----

Replaces the child at the given index of an existing node with the given new child.

<Code lang="typescript">{`replaceChildAtIndex(index: number, child: Node)`}</Code>

----

Returns the number of children associated with this node.

<Code lang="typescript">{`readonly childCount: number`}</Code>

----

Updates the style of an existing node.

<Code lang="typescript">{`setStyle(style: Style)`}</Code>

----

Returns the current style of a node.

<Code lang="typescript">{`getStyle(): Style`}</Code>

----

Marks the node as dirty and propagates this up the node tree. This function is called internally for any mutating function. The only time you have to ensure to call it manually is if some application state has changed which will effect the intrinsic size of a leaf node. For example if the text of a text node has changed. 

<Code lang="typescript">{`markDirty()`}</Code>

----

Returns whether of not this node is marked as dirty and will need to be recalculated during the next layout pass.

<Code lang="typescript">{`isDirty(): boolean`}</Code>

----

Computes the layout of a node tree given a size. The size passed in is used to compute percentage sizes on the root node. If you don't need to do this then it is fine to pass `{null, null}` however you will typically pass in the size of the viewport which will host this computed layout. The resulting tree of `Layout` nodes mimics the structure of the computed `Node` tree and includes position and size information..

<Code lang="typescript">{`computeLayout(size: {width?: number, height?: number})`}</Code>

# Style
The `Style` object contains all the properties associated with flexbox as well as some properties which we found useful outside of flexbox. For example `positionType` can be set to `PositionType.Absolute` which puts the node into a absolute layout context instead of a flexbox context. `aspectRatio` is another property not part of the flexbox specification which when set ensures the node matches a certain aspect ratio.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
type Dimension = string | number; // '100%', '100', 100, or 'auto'
 
type Style = {
    display?: Display,
    positionType?: PositionType,
    direction?: Direction,
    flexDirection?: FlexDirection,
    flexWrap?: FlexWrap,
    overflow?: Overflow,
    alignItems?: AlignItems,
    alignSelf?: AlignSelf,
    alignContent?: AlignContent,
    justifyContent?: JustifyContent,
 
    start?: Dimension,
    end?: Dimension,
    top?: Dimension,
    bottom?: Dimension,
 
    marginStart?: Dimension,
    marginEnd?: Dimension,
    marginTop?: Dimension,
    marginBottom?: Dimension,
 
    paddingStart?: Dimension,
    paddingEnd?: Dimension,
    paddingTop?: Dimension,
    paddingBottom?: Dimension,
 
    boarderStart?: Dimension,
    boarderEnd?: Dimension,
    boarderTop?: Dimension,
    boarderBottom?: Dimension,
 
    flexGrow?: number,
    flexShrink?: number,
    flexBasis?: Dimension,
 
    width?: Dimension,
    height?: Dimension,
 
    minWidth?: Dimension,
    minHeight?: Dimension,
 
    maxWidth?: Dimension,
    maxHeight?: Dimension,
 
    aspectRatio?: number,
}
`}</Code>

----

`AlignItems` describes how to align children along the cross axis of their parent. `AlignItems` is very similar to `JustifyContent` but instead of applying to the main axis, `AlignItems` applies to the cross axis.

- `FlexStart` aligns children of a container to the start of the container's cross axis.
- `FlexEnd` aligns children of a container to the end of the container's cross axis.
- `Center` aligns children of a container in the center of the container's cross axis.
- `Baseline` aligns children of a container to the baseline of that container's cross axis.
- `Stretch` stretches children of a container to match the height of the container's cross axis.

Optional, if left undefined `Stretch` is the default value.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
enum AlignItems {
    FlexStart,
    FlexEnd,
    Center,
    Baseline,
    Stretch,
}
`}</Code>

----

`AlignSelf` has the same options and effect as setting `AlignItems` on the containing node but instead of affecting the children within the node you can apply this property to a single child to change its alignment within its parent. `AlignSelf` overrides any option set on the parent with `AlignItems`.

- `Auto` delegates to the parent's `AlignItems` property.
- `FlexStart` aligns children of a container to the start of the container's cross axis.
- `FlexEnd` aligns children of a container to the end of the container's cross axis.
- `Center` aligns children of a container in the center of the container's cross axis.
- `Baseline` aligns children of a container to the baseline of that container's cross axis.
- `Stretch` stretches children of a container to match the height of the container's cross axis.

Optional, if left undefined `Auto` is the default value.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
enum AlignSelf {
    Auto,
    FlexStart,
    FlexEnd,
    Center,
    Baseline,
    Stretch,
}
`}</Code>

----

`AlignContent` defines the distribution of lines along the cross-axis. This only has effect when items are wrapped to multiple lines using `FlexWrap`.

- `FlexStart` aligns wrapped lines to the start of the container's cross axis.
- `FlexEnd` aligns wrapped lines to the end of the container's cross axis.
- `Center` aligns wrapped lines in the center of the container's cross axis.
- `Stretch` stretches wrapped lines to match the height of the container's cross axis.
- `SpaceBetween` evenly spaces wrapped lines across the container's main axis, distributing remaining space between the lines.
- `SpaceAround` evenly spaces wrapped lines across the container's main axis, distributing remaining space around the lines. Compared to space between using space around will result in space being distributed to the beginning of the first lines and end of the last line.

Optional, if left undefined `Stretch` is the default value.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
enum AlignContent {
    FlexStart,
    FlexEnd,
    Center,
    Stretch,
    SpaceBetween,
    SpaceAround,
}
`}</Code>

----

The `Direction` property specifies whether the component should be laid out in `LTR` or `RTL` writing mode.

Optional, `Inherit` by default (root node will implicitly default to `LTR`).

<Code lang="typescript">{`
enum Direction {
    Inherit,
    LTR,
    RTL,
}
`}</Code>

----

The `Display` property specifies whether the component should be laid out as `Flex` or not at all. If `None` is specified then the node will have a resulting size of zero. In the future this enum will be expanded to include more display options such as `Grid`.

Optional, `Flex` by default.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
enum Display {
    Flex,
    None,
}
`}</Code>

----

`FlexDirection` controls the direction in which children of a node are laid out. This is also referred to as the main axis. The main axis is the direction in which children are laid out. The cross axis the axis perpendicular to the main axis, or the axis which wrapping lines are laid out in.

- `Row` aligns children from left to right. If wrapping is enabled then the next line will start under the first item on the left of the container.
- `Column` aligns children from top to bottom. If wrapping is enabled then the next line will start to the left first item on the top of the container.
- `RowReverse` aligns children from right to left. If wrapping is enabled then the next line will start under the first item on the right of the container.
- `ColumnReverse` aligns children from bottom to top. If wrapping is enabled then the next line will start to the left first item on the bottom of the container.

Optional, if left undefined `Row` is the default value.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
enum FlexDirection {
    Row,
    Column,
    RowReverse,
    ColumnReverse,
}
`}</Code>

----

`JustifyContent` describes how to align children within the main axis of their container. For example, you can use this property to center a child horizontally within a container with `FlexDirection` set to `FlexDirection.Row` or vertically within a container with `FlexDirection` set to `FlexDirection.Column`.

- `FlexStart` aligns children of a container to the start of the container's main axis.
- `FlexEnd` aligns children of a container to the end of the container's main axis.
- `Center` aligns children of a container in the center of the container's main axis.
- `SpaceBetween` evenly spaces of children across the container's main axis, distributing remaining space between the children.
- `SpaceAround` evenly spaces of children across the container's main axis, distributing remaining space around the children. Compared to space between using `SpaceAround` will result in space being distributed to the beginning of the first child and end of the last child.
- `SpaceEvenly` evenly spaces of children across the container's main axis, distributing remaining space around the children so that visually there is equal space around every child including at the edges.

Optional, if left undefined `FlexStart` is the default value.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
enum JustifyContent {
    FlexStart,
    FlexEnd,
    Center,
    SpaceBetween,
    SpaceAround,
    SpaceEvenly,
}
`}</Code>

----

The `Overflow` property specifies how the node should handle children which overflow their parent's size. This property is currently not used but may be used in the future.

Optional, `Visible` by default.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
enum Overflow {
    Visible,
    Hidden,
    Scroll,
}
`}</Code>

----

The `PositionType` property specifies whether the component should be laid out relative to its sibling or absolutely positioned within its parent.

Optional, `Relative` by default.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
enum PositionType {
    Relative,
    Absolute,
}
`}</Code>

----

The `FlexWrap` property controls what happens when children overflow the size of the container along the main axis. By default children are forced into a single line (which can shrink components).

- `Wrap` enables wrapping of children if they overflow the main axis of the container.
- `NoWrap` disables wrapping of children, children will instead shrink to fit the main axis or overflow depending on their `flexShrink` setting.
- `WrapReverse` enables wrapping of children if they overflow the main axis of the container. Unlike `Wrap`, lines are laid out in reverse order.

Optional, if left undefined `NoWrap` is the default value.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
enum FlexWrap {
    NoWrap,
    Wrap,
    WrapReverse,
}
`}</Code>

----

When `PositionType` is set to `PositionType.Relative` the `start`, `end`, `top`, and `bottom` properties specify the offset the node should have from its default position. In the case position is set to `PositionType.Absolute` these properties indicate the distance this node's edge should be from the container's corresponding edge.

All position properties are optional and `undefined` by default.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
start: Dimension
end: Dimension
top: Dimension
bottom: Dimension
`}</Code>

----

Margin effects the spacing around the outside of the node it is applied to. A node with margin will offset itself from the bounds of its parent but also offset the location of any siblings. If  margin is set to auto then the margin is equal to the remaining space in that axis divided between all other auto margin values in that axis.

As apposed to layout engines Stretch does not support setting left/right margin but instead uses start/end to ensure equal support for right-to-left as well as left-to-right locales. In left-to-right locales start corresponds to left and end to right, the opposite is true in right-to-left locales.

All margin properties are optional and `undefined` by default, resulting in no margin.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
marginStart: Dimension
marginEnd: Dimension
marginTop: Dimension
marginBottom: Dimension
`}</Code>

----

Padding affects the size of the node it is applied to. Padding will not add to the total size of a node if it has an explicit size set, instead it will inset the content. For auto-sized nodes padding will increase the size of the node as well as offset the location of any children.

As apposed to layout engines Stretch does not support setting left/right padding but instead uses start/end to ensure equal support for right-to-left as well as left-to-right locales. In left-to-right locales start corresponds to left and end to right, the opposite is true in right-to-left locales.

All padding properties are optional and `undefined` by default, resulting in no padding.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
paddingStart: Dimension
paddingEnd: Dimension
paddingTop: Dimension
paddingBottom: Dimension
`}</Code>

----

Border affects the size of the node it is applied to. Border will not add to the total size of a node if it has an explicit size set, instead it will inset the content. For auto-sized nodes border will increase the size of the node as well as offset the location of any children.

As apposed to layout engines Stretch does not support setting left/right border but instead uses start/end to ensure equal support for right-to-left as well as left-to-right locales. In left-to-right locales start corresponds to left and end to right, the opposite is true in right-to-left locales.

All border properties are optional and `undefined` by default, resulting in no border.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
boarderStart: Dimension
boarderEnd: Dimension
boarderTop: Dimension
boarderBottom: Dimension
`}</Code>

----

Flex grow describes how any space within a container should be distributed among its children along the main axis. After laying out its children, a container will distribute any remaining space according to the flex grow values specified by its children. Flex grow accepts any floating point value >= 0. A container will distribute any remaining space among its children weighted by the child’s flex grow value. If `flexGrow` is set to 0 the node will not grow.

Optional, if left undefined `0.0` is the default value.

<Code lang="typescript">{`flexGrow: number`}</Code>

----

Flex shrink describes how to shrink children along the main axis in the case that the total size of the children overflow the size of the container on the main axis. flex shrink is very similar to flex grow and can be thought of in the same way if any overflowing size is considered to be negative remaining space. These two properties also work well together by allowing children to grow and shrink as needed. Flex shrink accepts any floating point value >= 0. A container will shrink its children weighted by the child’s flex shrink value. If `flexShrink` is set to 0 the node will not shrink.

Optional, if left undefined `1.0` is the default value.

<Code lang="typescript">{`flexShrink: number`}</Code>

----

Flex basis is an axis-independent way of providing the default size of an item along the main axis. Setting the flex basis of a child is similar to setting the width of that child if its parent is a container with `FlexDirection.Row` or setting the height of a child if its parent is a container with `FlexDirection.Column`. The flex basis of an item is the default size of that item, the size of the item before any flex grow and flex shrink calculations are performed.

Optional, similar to width and height the default value is undefined which means that the flex basis is determined by the size of the node's content.

<Code lang="typescript">{`flexBasis: Dimension`}</Code>

----

The `width` and `height` properties specify the size of the node’s content area. Size can be specified in pixels, points, or a percentage of the parent size. If set to `undefined` or `'auto'` the size is calculated based on the node’s content. What is meant by content is based on the kind of node, for example the size of a text node is the size of the text being displayed while the size of a flexbox node is the total size of its children.

Optional, `'auto'` by default.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
width: Dimension
height: Dimension
`}</Code>

----

The maximum size of a node, these properties take priority over all other properties. If left undefined the node has no maximum size.

Optional, `undefined` by default.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
minWidth: Dimension
minHeight: Dimension
`}</Code>

----

The minimum size of a node, these properties take priority over all other properties. If left undefined the node has no minimum size.

Optional, `undefined` by default.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
maxWidth: Dimension
maxHeight: Dimension
`}</Code>

----

Configures the aspect ratio of a node, very useful for media content.

- Accepts any floating point value > 0.
- Defined as the ratio between the width and the height of a node e.g. if a node has an aspect ratio of 2 then its width is twice the size of its height.
- Respects the min and max dimensions of an item.
- Has higher priority than flex grow
- If aspect ratio, width, and height are set then the cross axis dimension is overridden.

Optional, if left undefined no aspect ratio is enforced.

<Code lang="typescript">{`aspectRatio: number`}</Code>

# Layout
`Layout` nodes are returned from a layout calculation and mimic the structure of the computed `Node` tree.

<Code lang="typescript">{`
class Layout {
  free(): void;
  readonly width: number;
  readonly height: number;
  readonly x: number;
  readonly y: number;
  readonly childCount: number;
  child(at: number): Layout;
}
`}</Code>
